I've been meaning to learn how to create mathematical animations for a while. After watching 3blue1brown, and some really cool videos that were submitted for his [Math of Summer Exposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a1fLEToyvU) event, I decided that I wanted to know how to use the python package that he created, called manim. And so I did, and created this very simple [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3F2XjuN8qU/) talking about the pythagoras theorem.

#### Sample code:
I think it's really cool that aside from simple edits (like adding audio), the video is entirely generated by code. Here's a snippet of the code:
```py
def place_next_to_edge(shape, edge_number, distance=0.5):
            def updater(mob, dt):
                vertices = shape.get_vertices()
                edge = vertices[edge_number-1] - vertices[edge_number]
                edge_center = vertices[edge_number] + edge/2
                edge /= np.linalg.norm(edge)
                edge_normal = np.array([edge[1], -edge[0], 0])
                mob.move_to(edge_center).shift(distance*edge_normal)
            return updater
```

This part of the code is there to ensure that the labels of the sides of the triangle stick to the edges they are associated with, while also always maintaining the right orientation.

#### Fun fact: 
When I was a freshman, me and some friends created an instagram page where we would post math memes. It actually grew quite the audience, but it has been inactive for a while now already. I thought this little snippet was the perfect little piece of content to post something on there again.
